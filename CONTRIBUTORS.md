# GEL Contributors
The following is the list of contributors. It is hopefully complete, but please let me know if you have contributed without being acknowldged or if you would like your specific contribution to be specified.

### Original Contributors
- Andreas Bærentzen created the library and has written most of the code not contributed by the people below.
- Jeppe Revall Frisvad has contributed greatly to the CGLA part of GEL and elsewhere.
- Christian Thode Larsen rewrote the classes in HMesh.

- Karran Pandey added the original code for Skeleton to Face Extrusion Quad Meshes.
- Rasmus Paulsen, Bjarke Jakobsen, Marek Misztal helped with structure and compilation on various platforms with testing and ideas.
- Henrik Aanæs provided the original LinAlg package, which is a set of simple but very useful Lapack bindings. However, these were later removed. GEL and PyGEL do not require a numerics library, and we now use Eigen in applications that use GEL.
